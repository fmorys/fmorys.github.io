# One Word

## "STYLE"
"Style" — a deceptively simple word, yet it embodies uniqueness. It's a word that I resonate with because it symbolizes the essence of individuality. In a world filled with people, each one of whom is living life in their own distinct way, it seems natural that every single person would develop their own distinct style - a unique and original way of expressing themselves. To me, the word "style" is the leap into a rabbit hole of human individuality.

So, what exactly is "style"? It's a word that defies a one-size-fits-all definition. In essence, style is the definition of self-expression. It applies not just to the brushstroke of an artist but also the stitch of a fashion designer, there are countless examples and in my opinion, the phrase "the way we do things" helps to embody all of them. Style is not confined to art and fashion; it's a deeply rooted aspect of our lives. So much so, that we can completely remove the presence of a person, yet their character remains in examples of their style.

The power of style lies in its ability to convey a personal language. I myself experience great joy when I recognize someone's unique style in their work. It's akin to recognizing the handwriting of a dear friend in a letter. We manage to notice it so quickly, yet it's the equivalent of a complex web of tiny little intricacies. It's an intimate connection that transcends the boundaries of aesthetics.

What makes style truly remarkable is how universal it is. We all have our original way of "doing things". We collect influences during our whole lives and we cherry-pick them to resonate with our character. These influences along with our innate feelings and character traits come together to create our own personal style. It's a testament to the shared human experience. However, the more our style diverges from the mainstream, the more recognizable it becomes. Artists and designers like Picasso, who had an unmistakable style, are celebrated not just in their home countries but worldwide. A Picasso is recognized as a Picasso, whether you're in Spain, the United States, or Japan. Style is the universal language of our inner self, a form of communication that needs no translation.

In my journey as a graphic design student, I’ve found that style is what influences every decision; every brushstroke, and every color and font choice, and as a result it is what determines how recognizable our work is, which can have a very pronounced effect on our careers. People in our industry especially should therefore work on themselves, expose themselves to unusual experiences, and let the world around us help shape their style into something truly distinguishable, rather than just sticking to the norm.

"Style" symbolizes the intricacies of individuality and human expression. It's a universal language that transcends borders and cultures. Whether through the iconic strokes of a renowned artist or the subtle nuances of the various ways each one of us goes about our daily activities, style is a reflection of the diversity that makes our world vibrant.
