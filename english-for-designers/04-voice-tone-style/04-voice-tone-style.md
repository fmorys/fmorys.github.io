# Voice, Tone and Style
To start off, this is a topic I still kind of struggle with. After moving to Prague I (just like many other people) went through an episode of reinventing myself, which includes the way I communicate. I had to adapt to new things and actually decide on who I want to be. It took some time and learning how to accept myself and I still have a way to go before I truly feel comfortable with myself but I definitely feel like I'm on the right track.

### Voice
Personal - I want the things I say to come out in a way which people can really "click" with. Being personal is the most human way to do that. It gives way to honesty and lets a person's character shine through.

Open - This goes hand in hand with my previous point. Communication is about exchanging opinions and you can't get those out if you're not open about what you want to say. I personally prefer being as open as possible. This does in a way of course depend on the person I'm talking to, but if I see that someone is genuinely interested in a topic and wants to explore the topic with me, I'm very open to talking about anything.

Honest - Being honest might become somewhat difficult when you get yourself into a situation where you're trying to please everyone. From my own experience, that's not a good place to be in. Being honest comes a long way in the sense of understanding who you are and it brings actual value to what you have to say.

### Tone 
Relatable - Not in the way that I'll try to appeal to as many people as possible. More in the way that I'd like to make a smaller number of people relate as much as possible. I do this for example by sometimes describing a niche stereotype - a thing which not many people experience but the ones that do know exactly what I'm talking about and it makes them feel more involved. I get a bigger kick out of sharing my specific frustration with a Blender plugin with the other 4 people on this continent that happen to be using it rather than discussing how my fridge is always empty.

Funny - There's a time and a place for everything but as a general rule - having fun is better than not having fun. I think it's as simple as that.

Unexpected - I don't do this too often but I like to play around with expectations. It's similar to how misdirection can be used in music. You lose the impression that you know what's coming next and it makes things way more interesting.

### Style 
Straight to the point - If anything makes me feel like I'm losing momentum, it's small talk and getting bogged down with unnecessary details. I like things to be concise and say what actually needs to be said.

Perceptive - I try to look at things from more than a single point of view. Exploring different points of view will in most cases help you get a more comprehensive understanding.

Friendly - Anything else tends to be boring.
