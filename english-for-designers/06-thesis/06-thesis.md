Hello, I'm Philip, and I'm excited to show you my bachelor's thesis. The subject of which is crafting the visual style of a racing game. You might be wondering why I'd do such a thing and there are three key reasons driving my decision.

Firstly, it's fun. Racing games inherently offer a fun experience, and my fascination with the genre goes back to my childhood when I got introduced to it by my father. I find exploring various racing game examples and examining how graphic design influences their legacy to be genuinely engaging. Additionally, paying homage to older racing games by replicating their style adds an extra layer of enjoyment. Personally, I really need a topic which sparks my interest and helps me mantain focus.

Secondly, it's a valuable learning opportunity. Developing this concept has allowed me to set some time aside to start learning Blender. It was an opportunity to get better at some essential techniques including texturing and modeling. 

Lastly, it provides a solid foundation for future exploration. By establishing a visual style for a racing game, I'm laying the groundwork for a potential expansion into a fully developed game. Whether it's me or an actual game developer, this thesis serves as a springboard for future projects.

Now, let's delve into the focus of my thesis, which comprised six main steps:

1. Analyzing previous racing game styles, spanning from the 1980s to the present day.
2. Creating 3D environments and models tailored to the game's concept.
3. Developing the visual identity and user interface (UI) of the game.
4. Establishing in-game branding, including car brands and other automotive part manufacturers.
5. Crafting storytelling elements that intertwine with the in-game brands.
6. Designing promotional materials to showcase the game's features and style.

During the analysis phase, I played through several racing titles and I examined their design elements. For instance, titles like Automodelista were a significant inspiration due to their distinctive stylization and memorable menus. This exploration allowed me to explore the impact of graphic design on a game's legacy, particularly within a genre that has always attempted to stay at the bleeding edge of technology. 

The next step centered on developing 3D environments and models for the game. My aim was to strike a balance between authenticity and interesting stylization. I looked at the in-game menus as immersive spaces, devoid of excessive UI elements, to enhance the player’s immersion and navigation ease.

For the car models, I drew inspiration from real-world brands, utilizing AI-generated silhouettes as a foundation. Here you can see the two models I've created for the game, the first vehicle was inspired by american muscle cars, such as the Chevrolet Corvette, whereas the second model is inspired by old rally cars. These models were then refined to harmonize with the game's aesthetic, which heavily utilizes cel-shading, which is a style that mostly uses black outlines and hard shadows to emulate the look of a cartoon.

Each car was made to reflect it’s distinct driving characteristics, from the raw power of muscle cars focusing on straight line performance, to the agility of light, nippy rally vehicles.

Transitioning to the game environments, my main goal was to evoke nostalgia while ensuring a high level of immersion. For example, the design of the replay menu screen shows a retro TV with an old VHS player set in a 90’s style garage. It references the quote on quote “golden days” and it helps the player to feel at home within the game’s menus.

Moving on to step three: the visual identity and UI design. Here, I created a logo that integrates classic racing elements with a sort of a contemporary twist. I drew alot of inspiration from the logo of the Gran Turismo franchise, I added an element to the upper left corner which is meant to reference a checkered flag and I skewed the logo a bit to make it feel more dynamic.

In choosing the color scheme, I opted for a combination of dark blue and cyan. Cyan evokes the vibe of a sunny day at the racetrack, which is contrasted with the dark blue, reflecting the cool shadows of trees on a mountain pass course. This combination sets the tone for the game, capturing the dynamic atmosphere of the game’s environments.

Moving on to the font selection, I chose Clash Grotesk for its resemblance of the elements present in the game's logotype, while retaining a better legibility. Clash Grotesk is complemented by Clash Display for headlines.

As for the secondary font, Satoshi stood out for its minimalist aesthetic, contributing to a clean and cohesive visual presentation. Additionally, a system of icons was developed, drawing inspiration from the logo mark and incorporating elements such as hard and rounded corners, ensuring consistency with the game's overall design.

Moving on to the UI, an important element I came up with is the Adaptive Frame, which plays a role in enhancing the user experience. It’s designed to dynamically adjust to the size of the 3D render on the screen, it features elements that make themselves more or less visible as needed. For instance, the side arrows scale up during navigation, the top rectangle can expand into a pop-up window with information about the connection status of the players controllers and the dots on the sides can serve as indicators for interactive elements.

Step four involves in-game branding, where I focused on world-building by creating distinct brands with their own unique backstories. These brands involve, car brands, car tuning shops and trackside sponsors. Both the car brands and the car tuning shops have their own narrative, which enriches the in-game universe and helps to diversify the game world. These two cars tuned by two different shops can serve as an example. The car on the left embodies the essence of a modern underdog brand, which uses clever technology to enhance performance and speed. In contrast, the car on the right is more influenced by the timeless charm of a classic racing team, adhering to traditional values. Here you can see a list of all the fictional brands created for the game.

Step five focused on storytelling. By developing unique backstories for each brand in the game, I aimed to help establish them within the game world and make them more memorable for the player. My goal was to ensure that every brand mentioned in the game felt distinctly separate and uniquely its own. To achieve this, I made sure to go a completely different way regarding the narrative for each manufacturer For instance, lets take a look at the two examples of car tuning shops associated with the Javelin car brand in the game. One originates from an ex-aerospace company, drawing inspiration from its aviation roots, while the other is a group of outlaws who tinker with cars in their garage, doing their best to outrun authorities.

This method allowed me to quickly come up with compelling content while giving each brand with its own distinctive character. Overall, I'm very happy with the outcome.

Step six involved the creation of promotional materials to further enhance the game's market presence and engagement. First off, this is a special edition of the Nintendo Switch, featuring a colorway inspired by the game's palette. Beyond aesthetics, the inclusion of the game's logo on the right joy-con serves a functional purpose, indicating which of the joy-cons belongs to player one during multiplayer sessions. This is important so that the players know which of the joy-cons is used to pick a racing track for example.

Secondly, I designed automotive posters were designed to once again immerse the player in the game world but to also create a connection between the virtual spaces of the game and the player’s real world room. These posters, would be available for purchase on the game's eShop, allowing players to make their room look as close to their in game garage as possible.

Next, I came up with a basic landing page to serve as an information hub for players, offering news, game information, and purchase links. 

For social media, I utilized everything I've learned from doing social media graphics as my professional work. I came up with several examples of posts which serve to increase engagement with the game and promote purchaseable items, while also letting the players communicate with the devs and allow them to provide valuable feedback.

And that is pretty much all I have for my bachelor's thesis. I'm very satisfied with the outcome, and I will be even happier if I someday get the chance to actually present this in a working state, as a full video game.
