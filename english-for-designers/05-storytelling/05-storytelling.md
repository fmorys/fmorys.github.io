# Quality over quantity

Have you ever found yourself pausing from the relentless gaze at an empty file, wrestling to piece together creative ideas into a coherent design? Did that pause result in you getting comfy and preparing to spend some time scrolling your favourite short-form content platform and looking at brainrot served up to you by the algorithm? Too bad. The algorithm knows that you dabble in graphic design and today, that is what you’re going to get.
You tell yourself “This might come in handy, atleast I’ll get some inspiration.” You hear the AI text-to-speech lady, designed to have the most irritating voice possible, read out the dreaded words “I am a graphic designer and I made this!”

In about half the cases, what follows might actually be a showcase of works which make you go “Hey, the YouTube channel pumping out compilations of people climbing 100-story buildings was right, people really are awesome.” However, the rest results in you getting bombarded by the most soulless, generic, trend-adhering designs ever made. You go take a look at the person’s profile and notice that they have uploaded 8 videos just this week, 3 of which are visuals made to combine a word and an object in “clever” ways for the hundredth time (finally, the word “HOPE” with a little sun substituting the letter “O”, groundbreaking.) This person clearly has some sort of sense for aesthetics but they don’t seem to be trying to come up with anything that’ll leave an enduring impression. You notice the uncomfortably high amount of views, you take a look at the comments and see a surprising amount of praise (even though about half of the comments ask that you check out their similarly “vibrant” content in return).

You go back to the video feed, take the plunge and scroll one more time. You see a person designing a logo on their iPad in Procreate, using a stylus. You might think that this is just the sketch which they’ll use as a jumping-off point but no, this will be the final product. To make it worse, the final product is the letters, making up the name “Emily”, combined into a shape which can only be described as a man-made horror beyond human comprehension. You check their profile yet again and not only do you see 86 other people asking the person to do the same with their name, you also notice that this same person used to make pretty interesting illustrations just a year ago.

The abundance of views and comments, leaves you returning to your empty canvas with a series of nagging questions lingering in your head; “Is this all it takes?” “What’s the point in trying?”. This relentless pursuit of trying to satisfy the algorithm seems to prioritize fleeting internet fame over creating designs that solve problems, communicate effectively, and show any passion towards the craft.

Even though the examples mentioned here are the worst of the worst and I don’t expect anyone from this class to really take this approach, the point still stands. Short-term exposure is not more fulfilling than long-lasting impact. We should do better than throwing as many things as possible at the wall, seeing what might stick, even though such an approach might be appealing due to the algorithmic pressure.

The thing is, deciding to choose the career path of a graphic designer often leads to the infamous corporate job, which kind of points you in exactly this direction. You will get into situations where you’ll be forced to sacrifice quality for quantity and you’ll get praised for it. What’s more, you come home from work and you feel like you’ve done your fair share of work for today so why create anything else? I’ve gone through this and it made me end up in a situation where I started noticing myself getting less and less creative and dettaching from what I consider to be the thing I am actually pretty okay at and slowly but surely it reached a point when I wasn’t very proud of my own work, because it consisted of pumping out things I had no real attachment to. Even though I finally got the chance to do graphic design for decent money, I started to feel empty. The growing pressure of not feeling proud about my projects started to get to me and I even started getting anxious about designing the low effort stuff at work. So I started forcing myself to get back into the habit of working on my own passion projects and this paradoxically made me feel way less tired and way more excited about opening Photoshop. I got reminded that I am capable of more than what I was being told is “good enough”. I became more confident in my abilities and that in turn made me work quicker and come up with higher quality designs even at work.

We are all pressured into being successful, and even though the “easy way” might seem appealing, because it is “good enough”, it is passion that keeps you going and once you lose it, you stop. After coming to understand this I’ve realized that, provided you’re not in an extreme rush, it’s fine to come back to that blank file and spend some time messing around instead of trying to get to a solution as fast as possible and then running with that solution. You’ll come up with something that makes you really happy eventually and the fact that you’ll be proud of it will keep you going.
